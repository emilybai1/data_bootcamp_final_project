    "This project will look at how historical changes in school safety in various districts in New York City have had a correlation in home prices in their respective areas. New York City has 5 boroughs: Manhattan, Queens, Bronx, Brooklyn and Staten Island. We will be looking at data across various schools from NYC Open Data through __[this link](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2010-2016-School-Safety-Report/qybk-bjjc/data)__. Specifically, we will be focusing on the crime rate statistics for the years 2013 to 2016. \n",

    "We will use data from __[NYC Open Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Housing-Development/Annualized-Rolling-Sales-Update/uzf5-f8n2)__ and __[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/new-york-city/nyc-property-sales)__ to find information about housing prices in each of the five boroughs in the same time period as the school safety data. The ultimate goal of the project will be to visualize the correlation between school safety statistics and housing prices through a period of 3 years.\n",

    "While property value is affected by many variables, we want to focus on whether school safety has any correlation with the pricing. This does not imply causation but if there is a correlation, we would like to come up with a few possible explanations for it."

    "- Basic statistics about school safety. We will be reading in the excel document with information about schools in all five districts.\n",
    "- Next, we will aggregate data for house prices in each of the 5 boroughs by reading in the excel document. \n",
    "- The last step is to merge the two dataframes by matching the zip code and grouping them by boroughs using the isin function. - The results will be visualized through several graphs exploring the correlation between crime and housing prices. We want to know 3 things: __1)__ What is the overall correlation between housing prices and school safety in NYC? Is there any relationship at all?, __2)__ Have there been changes through the three observable years in terms of pricing and crime rate?, and __3)__ Do certain boroughs have a higher correlation? Are certain boroughs more or less dynamic in terms of housing prices and do certain boroughs have higher school crime rates, which may affect the pricing?\n",
    "- Finally, we will try to include possible explanations of what we observed in our visualizations."

The x-axis is represented by the average number of crimes and the y-axis is represented by the sale price of houses. For the Total Crime vs. Housing Prices graph, the bigger dots represent a higher amount of average crimes in that area. For the Average Crime vs. Housing Prices graph, the bigger dots represent a higher amount of total crimes for a given year. From 2013 - 2016, the graphs show that most of the dots are concentrated around the bottom left, which indicates low crime and low housing prices. However we can see that for the few data points that are on the right hand side of the graph (representing higher crimes), the housing prices tend to be low. While lower crime areas have low housing prices as well, the only data points that represent higher prices are also on the left side of the plot, also the areas with lower crime rates. "

    "By visualizing the data for each year, you can see if there are any changes or trends in the past few years regarding the statistics we are focusing on. For this process, we found the average sale price and average crime rate for each borough and then created a histogram to graph the changes per year. From these graphs, we can make the following conclusions:\n",
    "- The average number of total crime in the Bronx increased slightly in the three year period\n",
    "- The average number of total crime for both Brooklyn and Manhattan were higher in 2014-15 than in the other two years\n",
    "- The average number of total crimes in Staten Island is the highest among the 5 boroughs in all three years, with only Manhattan having a similar amount in 2014-15\n",
    "- Manhattan average housing prices are signficiantly higher than the other four boroughs, and Staten Island has the lowest average housing prices\n",
    "- The graphs show that while Staten Island crime rates are the highest in schools, they have the lowest housing prices. This is consistent with the scatter plots above where the dots where there are higher amounts of crime, the housing prices are lower than areas with lower crime.\n",
    "- Manhattan also has relatively large amounts of crime, but they have significantly higher housing prices than the other boroughs. There are other reasons for this that are unrelated to safety, but from the Total Crime vs. Housing Prices scatter plot, we can see several data points that account for this (higher crime and higher housing prices). However, they are scattered and not concentrated, suggesting that among the entire city, areas with lower crimes tend to have higher property value than areas where school safety is more of a concern.

    "3. We will visualize the data for each of the boroughs, which can give us information on whether certain boroughs are safer than others or whether the correlation between pricing and safety is stronger in one area than another. We can control for the passage of time by the fact that the time period we had data for was a relatively short period of time and from the graphs in part 2, we can see that there weren't any major disruptions towards the general data trends so we can assume that the trends for each borough through the three years are relatively representative for each borough for the recent years."

    "Our third graph shows the average housing price and average total crime by borough (by calculating the means of each for the three years we have data for). This side by side comparison allows us to look at the results by sectors of the city. A few conclusions from this graph are:\n",
    "- Queens has the total average crime around schools and Staten Island has the most. However, both of these boroughs have the lowest housing prices. \n",
    "- On the other hand, Manhattan has very high housing prices and one of the highest crime rates at schools.\n",
    "- This graph suggests that the correlation between housing prices and total crime may not be that signficant. The rates of crime around schools do not differ that significantly, and housing prices are generally lower in areas with higher crime, but the case of Manhattan and Queens goes against that correlation. \n",
    "- We can conclude that a weak correlation may exist but the difference in housing prices are probably best explained by other factors."

    "Lastly, we imported a shapefile of NYC to better visualize our statistics on a geographical map. From the map showing housing prices, we can see that the Manhattan area is signficantly darker, representing higher prices. From the second map showing average total crime rates for 2013-2016, we can see areas where there are more crimes in schools. This map could be useful to visualize regions where school safety is more of an issue and could be addressed. "

    "__In conclusion__, to recap, we mainly used NYC Open Source as our data source. We read in data for school safety and housing sale prices for three years, 2013-14, 2014-15 and 2015-16. Ideally, we would have analyzed this data over a longer period of time but the accessible data we found was limited so we worked with what we had. We organized the data into various ways with dataframes by year, borough and zip code. The statistics we focused on included Total Crime, Average Total Crime and Sale Prices. We merged our school safety data frame with the housing data to form new dataframes. In the last part, we were able to draw some conclusions from the visualizations we produced. \n",
    "\n",
    "We did not find a strong correlation with school safety and housing prices for the NYC boroughs. We found that Manhattan had very high housing prices and also higher relative school crimes, while Queens had low housing prices but also had one of the lowest school crime rates. However, in general, as shown through the scatter plots which plotted Zip code data for all boroughs and all years, areas with lower crime rates contained higher housing prices. A possibile explanation for this could simply be that people want to live in safe school areas for the benefit of their children. A better safety area near schools also could imply higher standard of living since negative activit affects the community less. "
