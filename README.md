Project Description

This project will look at how historical changes in school safety in various districts in New York City have had a correlation in home prices in their respective areas. New York City has 5 boroughs: Manhattan, Queens, Bronx, Brooklyn and Staten Island. We will be looking at data across various schools from NYC Open Data through this link. Specifically, we will be focusing on the crime rate statistics for the years 2013 to 2016. We will use data from NYC Open Data and Kaggle to find information about housing prices in each of the five boroughs in the same time period as the school safety data. The ultimate goal of the project will be to visualize the correlation between school safety statistics and housing prices through a period of 3 years. While property value is affected by many variables, we want to focus on whether school safety has any correlation with the pricing. This does not imply causation but if there is a correlation, we would like to come up with a few possible explanations for it.
